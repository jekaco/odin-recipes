    <h2>Description: </h2>
    <p>This Japanese fruit sandwich, also called fruit sando or strawberry sando, 
    is a Japanese sandwich made with fresh strawberries and other fruit, sliced 
    white bread or milk bread (shokupan), and fresh whipped cream!</p>
    <p>Japanese fruit sando is a great summertime fruit sandwich because it shows off 
    the beautiful, vibrant fruit that's in season. It tastes similar to Japanese 
    Strawberry Shortcake, but more convenient because it's doesn't involve any 
    baking which is perfect for summer!</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Whip the heavy cream until it forms stiff peaks. Don't over whip the heavy 
      cream or it will become grainy.</li>
      <li>Apply a layer of whipped cream to a slice of bread and arrange the 
      strawberries so that it will reveal the cross section when cut in half or 
      quarters. Plan out ahead how you'd like the design to look.</li>
      <li>Cover the strawberries with the whipped cream, taking care to fill in any 
      gaps between the fruit. Lay the slice of bread on top and tightly wrap with 
      plastic wrap. Mark where the strawberries and other fruit are placed so you 
      remember where to cut the sandwich.</li>
      <li>Place the fruit sando in the fridge for at least 20 minutes up to overnight 
      to set.</li>
      <li>Unwrap and cut off the crust. Remember where to slice in half to reveal 
      the mosaic fruit design.</li>
    </ol>
