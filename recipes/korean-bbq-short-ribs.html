    <!-- Gives description of the recipe -->
    <h2>Description: </h2>
    <p>This is an easy way to make Korean short ribs. You can also substitute chicken 
    breast or sliced rib-eye for the short ribs. If you use chicken or rib-eye, you 
    must add thinly sliced green onion tops. This can also be broiled in the oven for 
    the same amount of time.</p>

    <!-- List ingredients -->
